# YardsGhost

My first game project. I'm using this project for learning and
boost my skills with Unreal Engine 5.
This game is about an little boy who lost a lot of balls in your 
neighbor's yard. Until one day, he feels tired of losing his
balls and decide to rescue the lost balls, but is faced with a 
frightening element.
Try to escape to the while rescuing your lost balls.
